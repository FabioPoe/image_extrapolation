# image_extrapolation
In this project for programing in python 2 i had to create a python programm which extrapolates an image border to make it bigger. 
Here in this repository are all files i used for this project, exept for the training data, because this would be way to much data for Github. The file "main.py is the most important of this repository, in this file you can see the code i used to train the CNN. Another important file is the file "data_preprocessing.py", where you can see how i preprocessed the data, at first glance some steps might seem complicated or even unnessecary, but i did it this way to save training time.
For my final model i just used a CNN, because it performed best out of everything i tried. I trained the CNN with google colab, because they have fast CPUs.
