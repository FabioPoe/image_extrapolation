# image_extrapolation
In this project for programing in python 2 i had to create a python programm which extrapolates an image border to make it bigger. 
Here in this repository are all files i used for this project, exept for the training data, because this would be way to much data for Github.
For my final model i just used a CNN, because it performed best out of everything i tried. I trained the CNN with google colab, because they have fast CPUs.
